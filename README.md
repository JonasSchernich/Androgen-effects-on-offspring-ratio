## Androgen Effect on Offspring Ratio
For many years, there has been anecdotal evidence suggesting that the use of exogenous androgens in males increases the likelihood of having female offspring. Various mechanisms have been proposed, such as increased oxidative stress primarily damaging the Y chromosomes. However, no research has directly tested this hypothesis, and data on the subject is very limited.
I manually searched for some data and wrote code to analyze the topic, but more data and the inclusion of age as a covariate are necessary for a more comprehensive analysis.
